istep is the # of time steps, istable specifies after which step we 
start calculating properties
iprint means the program will print properties per so many steps.

ini_new (1 if generating new system, 0 if reading in from file)
iscale_x (1 if scaling x, 0 no scaling), iscale_v(1 if scaling v, 0 no scaling)

req_temp is the preset temperature and xlcd is the lattice constant.
They determine the initial x and v scale if iscale_x = 1 or iscale_v = 1.

ncell(3) are the  numbers of unit cells in x, y, z direction.
Their product shouldn't exceed 2500 and it has no effect when ini_new=0.

isquench (1 if quenching, 0 no quenching), iquench is the # of steps 
between quenching,
and coeff_quench is the quenching coefficient.
